## Introduction

Web3 OAuth empowers users by seamlessly linking their social identities to a single source.

You might wonder, "Isn't this what Google and Facebook already do?"

The distinction lies in our unique features.

Firstly, users can create a variety of identities and selectively choose which one to share with a decentralized application (dApp).

But that's not all; imagine a scenario where a user grows tired of their profile picture â€“ with our platform, they can effortlessly update it on their dashboard, and the change reflects across all instances where the user has opted for that identity.

## Project Status

The project is currently live and ready for use. However, the Software Development Kit (SDK), crucial for facilitating seamless interactions among "us" (Web3 OAuth), the "dApp," and "you" (the user), is still undergoing active development.

## Repository Structure

This repository comprises several key directories: `backend`, `client`, `dev`, and `sdk`. Each of these directories contains a `README.md` file, providing comprehensive insights into the significance of the folders.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

## Note

In the root directory, you'll find the smart contract code and accompanying test files.
